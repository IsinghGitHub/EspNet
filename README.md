The ESPNet can be described as an "Efficient Spatial Pyramid of Dilated Convolutions for Semantic Segmentation". 

I have trained the model in Anaconda using few sample images which I took in dublin. The test results and described below.

## Simple Stpes to Insall the required libraries and  Execute the Algorithm in Analconda.
